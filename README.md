The goal of the project was to build a machine learning model that focus on data consisting of customer characteristics and various amenities / services to predict the customer satisfaction for an airline.

I used the "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" data set from Kaggle to build four different models in R: Random Forest, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression.
